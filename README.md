<H1> AIDEN </h1>
<h3> Artificial Intelligence Data ENgine </h3>
<sub> <i><b>Current Model:</b> GPT-Turbo-3.5</i> </sub>
<br><br>

<p> AIDEN is a WIP python Chat GPT implementation. Being built using the `openAI` Python library</p>

<p> AIDEN serves mainly as an assistant just like normal Chat GPT, but eventually AIDEN will be able to fire of functions within his code simply by being told to do so, AKA saving a file, saving code examples to files, sending texts, etc. </p>

<h3> Running AIDEN </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Clone the repo </li>
  <li> Ensure Docker is installed </li>
  <li> CD into `/AIDEN/` </li>
  <li> `docker compose up -d`</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>Note:</b><br>
  <i>Eventually, once AIDEN has the Chat GPT-4 model, we'll be able to do even more complex things with AIDEN, but for now it's mainly here for testing and preperation.</i>
